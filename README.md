# OpenMeets

Event management platform built with Svelte, TypeScript, FastAPI, and GraphQL.

## About

OpenMeets is a multi-tenant event management platform that enables organizations to create, manage, and host events with integrated ticketing, payments, and attendee management.

**Key Principle:** All events are created under organizations. Users join organizations as admins or members, and organization admins can assign members to event staff roles (organizer, co-organizer, volunteer, security).
